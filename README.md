# Revealing-the-Effects-of-Prompt-Modifiers
Controlled text-to-image experimentation platform using Stable Diffusion via ComfyUI with fixed parameters (seed, CFG, sampler, scheduler, resolution). Prompts use weighted semantic modifiers for systematic sweeps. Outputs are embedded in CLIP space, projected with UMAP, and scored to analyze prompt sensitivity and attribute interaction.
